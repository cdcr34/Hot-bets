# Hot-bets

This app lets you calculate your expected return on a sports bet after the odds move, based on the historical ROI of a bettor you're following. I find bettors through Betstamp and base the ROI off of individual betting types over the past three months. If you want to support me, download Betstamp and use promo code CCHRISTENSEN when you sign up.
